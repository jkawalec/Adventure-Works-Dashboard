## Documentation

I created a Dashboard with an Executive Summary, Product Detail and Customer Detail pages. I began the project by setting up the correct schema. I then created all the measures that I needed for the Dashboard. I then created the Executive Summary page and included all the different visualizations that appropriately provided an overall summary of the project. I then created a Product Detail page to go more in depth on the Product Sales Information. I then created a Customer Detail page to go more in depth on the Customer Sales Information. I also made the Dashboard interactive and linked the three pages to each other.
